### Showcase of learning a rhombus using decision trees with different amount of features
>To start off, this is the graph with the rhombus that our machine have to differentiate whether or not a point is inside the rhombus.

>By choosing 2 features with a tree depth of 10, the machine was able to eventaully learn how to differentiate the difference but at a very slow rate.

>By choosing 4 features with a tree depth of 10, the machine was a lot faster in correcting it's errors and recognizing the rhombus with much more accuracy.

>Finally, by choosing 5 features with a tree depth of 10, the machine was able to instantly recognize the solution with 100% accuracy for this particular problem.
